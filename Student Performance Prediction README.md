# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting students’ final exam scores using machine learning techniques.  
The model analyzes academic factors such as study hours, attendance percentage, and previous exam scores to estimate final performance.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning workflow including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Educational institutions often want to identify students who may need academic support.  
By predicting final scores based on past performance and behavior, early interventions can be planned to improve outcomes.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

| Feature Name | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| study_hours | Average daily study hours |
| attendance | Attendance percentage |
| previous_score | Score obtained in the previous exam |
| final_score | Final exam score (target variable) |

> Note: A structured sample dataset is used for demonstration purposes.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine Learning models & evaluation
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
The following models were implemented and compared:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The performance of the models was evaluated using:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R² Score**

The Random Forest model achieved higher accuracy, demonstrating better generalization on test data.

---

## 📉 Visualization
An **Actual vs Predicted Score** scatter plot was created to visually evaluate model performance.  
Points close to the diagonal indicate high prediction accuracy.
