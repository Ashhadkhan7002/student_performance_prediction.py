## 📝 Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that estimates a student's final score using easily available features like:

- **Study Hours**: Number of hours the student studies.
- **Attendance**: Class attendance percentage.
- **Previous Score**: Score obtained in previous exams.

The project uses **Python**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn** for data handling and modeling.
